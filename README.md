### ðŸ”¨ Current status: Release Candidate 2 (rc2)

Most of the work has been done already. However, we are still developing and enhancing it. Storefront API 1.0rc2 is compatible with Vue Storefront 1.11+. The stable release (1.0) is planned for **2020Q4**. Only then, it will replace the `vue-storefront-api` middleware for Vue Storefront (release 1.13). Till then it's not recommended for production applications.

Storefront GraphQL API. Easy to use. Extendable. Blazingly fast. ElasticSearch included. [BFF (Backend for frontend)](https://samnewman.io/patterns/architectural/bff/) driven.
Works great with: Magento1, Magento2, Spree, OpenCart, and Pimcore - out of the box. [Easy to integrate with custom backends](https://docs.storefrontapi.com/guide/integration/integration.html#two-steps-for-the-integration).

You can use the **Storefront GraphQL API** to integrate **all your backend systems** with your eCommerce frontend under a single GraphQL/REST API.
By default, all catalog information is stored in ElasticSearch, and all the write operations are forwarded to the **platform driver** (Magento1, Magento2, Spree, and others available).

## How to get started?

Storefront API comes with a default product schema - compatible with the [Vue Storefront](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront) project - and can be a drop-in replacement for `vue-storefront-api`. You can  start a dev instance, including a demo data set integrated with a [Magento 2.3 demo instance](http://demo-magento2.vuestorefront.io).

To run `storefront-api` in `development` mode, please run:

`docker-compose up`

Restore the demo data set:
`docker exec -it sfa_app_1 yarn restore7`

After successful installation, you can start playing with GraphQL queries using your local GraphQL Playground, which is exposed under: [http://localhost:8080/graphql](http://localhost:8080/graphql)

## Modules

Storefront API does provide all the features, GraphQL schemas, ElasticSearch resolvers and API handlers via [Modules](https://docs.storefrontapi.com/guide/modules/introduction.html). That's it. The default schema and the features described in the further parts of the documentation have been implemented by the `default-catalog`, `default-img` and `default-vsf` modules. You can customize them, clone or disable.

Each module provides it's own:
- GraphQL schema and resolvers,
- ElasticSearch mappings,
- API methods - via express.js handlers and middlewares.

## Production-ready

Storefront API originated from the [`vue-storefront-api`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront-api) project and is currently [backing 30+ production sites](https://www.vuestorefront.io/live-projects/), including: [Zadig&Voltaire](https://zadig-et-voltaire.com/pt/en/), [Klebefieber](https://www.klebefieber.de/), [Wonect](https://wonect.com/sg/) and others.

## Documentation

Please check our [**Official documentation**](https://docs.storefrontapi.com/). You will find there some integration and customization tutorials, and the API specification.

## Example use cases

 - **Headless eCommerce data source** for any React/Vue/Angular frontend connected to Magento or any other supported eCommerce platform,
 - **GraphQL Gateway** which takes data from **an existing REST API and mixes it** with ElasticSearch or Database data,
 - **Custom GraphQL schema** - optimized for your backend platform,
 - **Custom eCommerce Backend** - by implementing custom Cart, User, Stock modules and re-using the Catalog service.

## Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose

The following are already included in the `storefront-api` Docker image, but required if you do not use containerization:
- Node.js 10.x or higher
- Yarn

## REST Access
Catalog API calls are compliant with ElasticSearch (they work like a filtering proxy to ES). More on ES query here: [ElasticSearch queries tutorial](http://okfnlabs.org/blog/2013/07/01/elasticsearch-query-tutorial.html)

The Elastic search endpoint is: `http://localhost:8080/api/catalog/search/<INDEX_NAME>/`. You can run the following command to check if everything is up and runing (it assumes `vue_storefront_catalog` as the default index name):

`curl -i http://elastic:changeme@localhost:8080/api/catalog/vue_storefront_catalog/_search`

## Data formats

The data formats can be easily modified to suit your needs by modifying the `src/graphql/elasticsearch/**` schemas and resolvers.
Check our [GraphQL Schema documentation](https://divanteltd.github.io/storefront-graphql-api-schema/) for the details regarding data formats.

## Adding custom modules with their dependencies (Yarn only)
When adding custom modules(https://docs.storefrontapi.com/guide/modules/introduction.html), you might want to define some dependencies inside them. Thanks to [Yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/), dependencies defined inside your custom module will be installed when you execute `yarn` at the project root level, so it's way easier and faster than installing all modules dependencies separately.

To do this, define the `package.json` with your dependencies in your custom module:
- `src/modules/{your-custom-extension}/package.json`
- `src/platforms/{your-custom-platform}/package.json`

NOTE: `npm` users will still have to install the dependencies individually in their modules.

## Self-signed certificates

In non-production environments, other services often use self-signed certificates for secure connections.
You can easily set up the application to trust them by putting them in the config/certs directory.

## The Story

Storefront API is brought to you by the [**Vue Storefront Team**](https://www.vuestorefront.io/) and is based on [Vue Storefront API](https://github.com/adempiere/vue-storefront-api). The intention is to replace vue-storefront-api with a more general-purpose API Gateway which you may use with any web or mobile frontend, including Vue, React, Angular and native apps. Its a drop-in replacement for `vue-storefront-api` if you happened to use it before. It works great with [Vue Storefront](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront).
